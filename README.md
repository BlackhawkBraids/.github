## How defaults work

GitHub applies these files to every repository in the organization that does **not** define its own version of the file. See [GitHub Docs — Default community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) for details.
